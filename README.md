**The SeaMonster Funder is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 13 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* I added a navbar to allow user to move to the our games and top game sections quickly
* I added a hover + glow effect for each game-card and game-button to make it more visually appeal
* I changed the colors of the first and second most funded game to gold and silver adding a glow effect to them also
* I changed some text centering to be easier to read

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The first medium article link to learn about Git was paywalled, so i had to open it on another browser.

I found some of the instructions to be slightly vague in what they were asking for especially in challenge 2, 
when some instructions like add a CSS rule don't make much sense when reading all of the instructions that follow.

The process overall was enjoyable, and I feel like I learned alot along the way!
